It's officially confirmed: Seattle Storm's Breanna Stewart, the 2018 WNBA MVP, will miss the 2019 WNBA season after rupturing her right Achilles tendon in the EuroLeague championship game in Hungary on Sunday. Stewart did not get MRI results back until Wednesday in Los Angeles. She will have surgery at a date to be determined. Stewart won four NCAA championships with UConn from 2013-16, and won the WNBA title with the Storm last year. She also has gold medals in the Olympics (2016) and FIBA Women's World Cup (2018) and hopes to return for 2020 WNBA season and 2020 Olympics.Minnesota knows what's up. � pic.twitter.com/lCGVacZAzT .@Niacoff is ready to get things started in Atlanta!
