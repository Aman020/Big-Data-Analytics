This policy is not intended to cover inconsequential factual errors, such as minor statistical mistakes, inadvertent and immaterial misidentifications, minor inaccuracies in a developing story or font errors that don't impair the viewers' understanding of a story.Each unit at ESPN -- such as Studio, Remote, Magazine, Radio, ESPN.com and other networks -- will implement this policy in a manner applicable to its medium. Corrections of significant factual errors across all media, as warranted, will be posted on ESPN.com's corrections page for a period of time.ESPN produces 24/7 programming and services, across many platforms and under fierce deadline pressures.
