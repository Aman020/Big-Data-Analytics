we’d love you to bring back your flags this saturday and make it another atmosphere to remember!pic.twitter.com/npzccwf5a2pep  we have to react (on saturday) but don’t think too much right now, sleep as much as possible and then we will prepare for the game. 

we fought a lot, nine, ten months for the premier league. it’s in our hands. it’s tough, of course, but we have to do it.pep  i am so proud, especially of the fans for the reaction. i never saw the stadium like today. we are sad for all of them but they know we have everything but football is unpredictable and unfortunately we are not in the next stage,pep  yeah, it’s tough. it’s cruel but we have to accept it. it was a nice game for everyone. second half we did everything. we scored the goals we needed but congratulations to tottenham and all the best for the semi-finals. 

 4-3 (4-4)  #cityvthfc #mancityfull-time | we gave it everything.
