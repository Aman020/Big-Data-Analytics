What Douglas did defied logic and the odds when he beat Iron Mike in 10 rounds. 42 to 1 tells the story of just how incredibly unlikely it was. Watch The Trailer     Bonus Scene+    Director's statement    More »In sports, we're used to seeing the improbable.  But the impossible is another matter entirely.  And on February 11, 1990, while the odds were technically 42 to 1, it was very much the impossible that happened in a boxing ring in Tokyo, Japan, when James "Buster" Douglas defeated Mike Tyson for the heavyweight championship of the world.The ESPN "30 for 30" documentary "42 to 1" tells the story of just how incredibly unlikely it was.  It starts in Columbus, Ohio, where Douglas grew up the son of a boxer, who trained and guided him to become a top-10 heavyweight contender in the mid 1980's.  Of course, it was all in the shadow of the rise of "Iron" Mike Tyson, who became a worldwide phenomenon in a remarkable undefeated run to the undisputed title.  And by the time their fight was set, Douglas was lightly regarded, merely a stepping stone for bigger fights for the champion.  But on the day they met, a series of extraordinary circumstances led to an unimaginable result.If you were a sports fan in 1990, you'll never forget where you were when you heard about Tyson-Douglas.  Because, after all, it was impossible.Most sports fans know the name Buster Douglas. They know he knocked out Mike Tyson, fashioning one of the greatest upsets ever, in all of sports. But they know almost nothing else about Douglas or his story. Our mission with "42 to 1" was to bring Buster Douglas and his journey to life. Most important, we wanted to explore just what it takes to achieve something spectacular, that will be talked about for as long as we are talking about sports. Almost since the instant at which Tyson was counted out, the story of the fight has been told from Tyson's perspective and Douglas's role in his own triumph has been minimized. "42 to 1", we hope, is a kind of corrective to that and a testament to one athlete's refusal to succumb to everyone else's expectations.
