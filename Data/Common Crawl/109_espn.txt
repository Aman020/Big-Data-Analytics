The All-Native District Basketball Tournament isn't a big a stage as the Final Four, but to the high school teams on Alaska's Bering Sea coast it's even bigger. Watch Every year they gather from tiny subsistence villages on Alaska's Bering Sea Coast, traveling hundreds of miles on bush planes to compete on the biggest stage they will ever know - the All-Yup'ik District Basketball Tournament. The hope of Toksook Bay is Byron Nicholai, a 16-year-old Alaskan Yup'ik teenager who is determined to lead his village to the championship.

For Byron, this tournament isn't just about basketball-it's a way to bring pride to his family and community.Daniele Anastasion directed the feature documentary "The Redemption of General Butt Naked," which premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.
