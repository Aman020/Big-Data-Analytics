Lineups shouldnt be shown to other members in the league. I hope you get it fixed because most of my friends find it annoying and are not thinking of joining the league. Thanks1. It has a super league which is all leagues and a Bol and other smaller ones which is great2. You can easily make your own mini league with your friends and you can make emblems and team names. Great.3. It has lots of fun little features such as in the mini league( the best part) you can offer some banter and they have awards weekly for the mini league which is great4. It has soccer news on the app to keep you updated. Perfect. (I know no great :))5. The app loaded fine for me but I am commenting this like a month later than the other guy6. The fantasy dynamics are really good. It awards different points for different positions which is great7. All in all you should get it and share it with friends. My mini league pin is 2355 so join and have some fun! The only con is that Defensive midfielders don't get the points they deserve like poohs. Defenders do tho because they get clean sheets.I think it's unfair to defender  and def-midfielders.A defender can play well in whole match but by another's mistake his team might not get clean sheet. And for smaller team it's tough to have clean sheet.For a defensive midfielder it's tough to make a clear assist and they also have to help their defence too.My suggestion is to add points for defender's tackle winning rate and midfielder's pass accuracy.If these problems are solved this is definitely a 5 star app...Requires iOS 10.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.English, German, SpanishWith Family Sharing set up, up to six family members can use this app.
