We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

(Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia.

But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia.

But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia.

But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over.

There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinQuarterback Johnny Manziel’s brief foray into the Canadian Football League ended abruptly on Wednesday when the league instructed the Montreal Alouettes to terminate Manziel’s contract for an undisclosed violation of terms and then barred any of the league’s other teams from signing the former Heisman Trophy winner.The Alouettes released a statement explaining that it was following orders from the C.F.L. to cut Manziel, 26, “after it was found that he had contravened the agreement which made him eligible to play in the league.”🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨The @MTLAlouettes have released QB Johnny Manziel.FOR MORE | https://t.co/IbobgzO908 pic.twitter.com/mzVY5dn4BK“We are disappointed by this turn of events,” the Alouettes’ general manager, Kavis Reed, said in a statement. “Johnny was provided a great deal of support by our organization, in collaboration with the C.F.L., but he has been unable to abide by the terms of his agreement. We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R. WeinbergerBaltimoreThe writer is director and chief executive of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and genetics at Johns Hopkins University,AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyPASADENA, Calif. — Last month, the Big Ten’s influential commissioner, Jim Delany, endorsed discussions to expand the College Football Playoff, just five seasons into the format’s 12-year contract.Expanding the four-team playoff to six or eight teams is likely to be a hot topic at the meetings many conferences will hold Monday, before that evening’s national championship game between Alabama and Clemson in Santa Clara, Calif.“It’s probably a good idea, given all the discussions and noise around the issue, to have conversations with our colleagues,” Delany told The Athletic.Delany might have ulterior motives — the Big Ten has now gone two seasons without getting a team into the playoff. But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersMILAN — An Italian television commentator has apologised for describing the presence of a lineswoman as "disgusting" and "a joke" at a regional match.Sergio Vessicchio's comments on CanaleCinqueTv came before kickoff at the match between Agropoli and Sant'Agnello on Sunday in the fifth tier of the Italian league as the lineswoman, Annalisa Moccia, was inspecting one of the nets."It is disgusting to see a woman as a match official in a league where clubs spend hundreds of thousands of euros," he said. "It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy.

We worked with the league and presented alternatives to Johnny, who was unwilling to proceed.”Reed told reporters in Montreal that the Alouettes had cut Manziel only because of the C.F.L. order.“No sir,” Reed said. “Mr. Manziel’s performance on the field showed that he had a very good upside. But Mr. Manziel violated the terms, and we all understood those terms and we have to be compliant with them.”Before he entered into negotiations with the Hamilton Tiger Cats last March, Manziel had to agree to several strict provisions in his contract, presumably because he had a history of substance abuse and arrests, including one related to accusations that he had struck a former girlfriend. But the specifics terms of the deal were not disclosed, and the league refused to make them public on Wednesday.“Mr. Manziel has been informed he must continue to meet a number of conditions in order to remain eligible,” the C.F.L. said in a statement last year. “These conditions, while extensive and exacting, remain confidential.”Manziel won the Heisman Trophy in 2012 after a dazzling season for Texas A&M. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 22nd overall pick in 2014 and started just eight games in two years with them. He was released in March 2016, after revelations of charges that he had struck and threatened the former girlfriend. Manziel and prosecutors came to a dismissal agreement, and he was required to seek counseling.Manziel wrote on his Twitter account that he hoped to play in the United States again. That could mean in one of two new development leagues. The Alliance of American Football began play this month. Another league, a revival of the XFL, is scheduled to begin play next February.“I look forward to exploring new options within the United States,” Manziel wrote.FREE AGENCY FOR FOLES Nick Foles rejuvenated his career in Philadelphia. Now he wants to turn his success into an N.F.L. starting job — and the Eagles intend to give him that chance.General Manager Howie Roseman told reporters on Wednesday that the team would not use the franchise tag on Foles, making him a free agent.Foles led the Eagles into the playoffs the last two seasons after their starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, was injured, and he was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last year when the Eagles won the title. But the Eagles were clear that Wentz, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2016, was their established starter.“It’s hard when you have someone who is incredibly valuable to your organization, the most important position in sports,” Roseman said during the N.F.L.’s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. “But at the same time, he deserves an opportunity to lead a team.” (AP)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Joe DrapeThere are a multitude of ways to lose money in sports, and historically one of the most dependable ways is to start a professional football league. Charlie Ebersol knows this better than most. He had a front-row seat when his father, Dick, the longtime NBC executive, was a partner with the XFL for its only season in 2001.Still, Charlie Ebersol, a co-founder of yet another new league, the Alliance of American Football, is bullish on his chances to beat the market. And he argues that timing and technology are on his side this time.The A.A.F.’s 10-week season opens Saturday and ends before the N.F.L. draft. This is by design, Ebersol said.“It would be an act of insanity to try to compete with the N.F.L.,” he conceded.Instead, Ebersol intends to fill a post-Super Bowl vacuum and feed a viewing audience that he and his partners believe has an insatiable appetite for football.“Two hundred million watch college and pro football compared to the 130 million combined that watch the other major sports,” Ebersol said. “We don’t need to get all of those football fans to tune back in, but I like our chances of getting a significant chunk of them.”To do so, the A.A.F. is working to make its games easy to find. In addition to a deal to place some of its games on the NFL Network, the A.A.F. has agreements with CBS Sports’s networks, TNT and Turner’s B/R Live streaming service.But the A.A.F. business plan goes beyond football and television; it is hoping to land in a right-place-right-time moment in which sports betting is now legal and expanding in the United States. Eight states already offer gambling on sports contests, and by next year, sports betting could be legal in at least a dozen more.Anticipating and embracing interest from serious and casual gamblers, the A.A.F. has invested heavily in the technology and platforms that can provide data in a blink of an eye, all in the hope of transforming a minor league football broadcast into an interactive experience. Among the A.A.F.’s early investors were venture capital firms like Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, media companies like the Chernin Group and the gambling and entertainment powerhouse MGM Resorts International.MGM executives said they were most taken by the A.A.F.’s app, which can provide a host of data in milliseconds. The information arrives so fast, in fact, that the league and its partners said it could eventually allow in-game betting on play outcomes — like pass or run — and a host of other propositions.“It’s a technology play,” Scott Butera, MGM’s president for interactive gaming, said of the A.A.F. “These specialty leagues will be relevant to sports betting. We think what they are doing is portable to other sports in terms of streaming, watching and making it an entertaining customer experience.”Ultimately, however, the A.A.F. will be judged by the quality of its football. To that end, a founder of the league, Bill Polian, a former general manager of the Buffalo Bills and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, has put together a league office of seasoned football people, including the former N.F.L. players Hines Ward and Troy Polamalu. The league owns all eight of the teams and has installed big-name veteran coaches — Steve Spurrier, Mike Singletary, Dennis Erickson, Mike Martz — in cities like Orlando, Memphis, Salt Lake City and San Diego.The league will lean on some gimmicks: There will be no kickoffs (teams will start on their 25-yard line instead) and no point-after kicks (only 2-point conversions allowed). And a so-called sky judge will keep watch over the action, empowered to correct officiating errors immediately.But some other innovations — no TV timeouts; completing games in two and a half hours; tickets priced no higher than $50; three-year, $250,000 contracts to hundreds of players — have raised questions about the league’s long-term economic viability.“There’s always been a belief that there’s room for spring football because of the game’s popularity,” said John Kosner, a longtime ESPN executive who now runs his own company, Kosner Media. The problem, he noted, is “no one has pulled this off before, so it’s not trivial what they are trying to do.”Kosner said the A.A.F.’s timing — just as sports betting tries to move into the mainstream of American culture — is fortuitous, since the amount of energy and venture capital investment available in sports right now is “unparalleled in my career.” He also suggested that Ebersol’s experience as a television and film producer would come in handy.“Charlie is smart, organized and patient, and best of all, he is a good storyteller,” Kosner said. “He can make the fans care about the game.”Seventy percent of the players signed so far have played in the N.F.L. in the past 18 months, a group that includes quarterback Aaron Murray (Atlanta Legends) and running back Trent Richardson (Birmingham Iron). All have been signed to a three-year base deal that includes not only the $250,000 salary but also what the league calls engagement bonuses. Those are based in part on their contributions to the community.And because the season is so short, all will be free to go to camp and sign with N.F.L. teams.“We are not trying to be sexy,” Ebersol said. “We just need to block and tackle on the field as well as off it.”For now, he is preaching patience.“This is going to take five to seven years, and there’s going to be empty seats at first,” Ebersol said. “I caution everyone that this is not going to be an overnight success. But we will succeed.”Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballBy Marc TracyThe 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game.Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback.Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff.College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all.Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings.The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk).“As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in.For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire.It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be.Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade.College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has.The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus.But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league.Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game.Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year  tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s.Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7.Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonARLINGTON, Tex. — Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys.The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state’s 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball.The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize.“It’s where to put your head that is the focus now,” Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. “Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, ‘Get your head out of it,’” he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States.After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous.That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was “under attack,” even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game — which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork — far outweighed its risks.“The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches’ awareness of concussions and all the things we’re trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that’s coming on board,” said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association.Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football.Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down.Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted “hawk tackling,” which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear “scrum caps’’ but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation:“We believe in tackling the legs,” he told the coaches. “We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice.”Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one’s power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. “It’s not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,” he said.Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus.But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level.And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players’ concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons — such as hitting their head on the turf — that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier.Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a “more fine-grained analysis” to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion.Still, he noted, “just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,” he said. He also said that from his perspective, “this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.’’At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour’s drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season.“When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,” he said of the rugby-style technique. “It’s a win-win.”As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus.Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas.“I’m not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn’t want her kids to play the game,” said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. “You can be as safe as you want to be, but it’s still a violent sport.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherThe most recent, less than Super Bowl notwithstanding, the N.F.L. continues to be a behemoth, dominating the sports landscape in revenue, attendance and television ratings.That popularity has over the years tempted entrepreneurs to try to cash in by starting professional football leagues of their own.

But John Swofford, the Atlantic Coast Conference commissioner, echoed Delany last week in Arlington, Tex., before Clemson played in its fourth straight national semifinal.“What I see is a willingness to evaluate, take a look and gauge what a bigger field would mean,” Swofford said. “What are the implications? And are there ways to make something that I think is outstanding at the moment even better?”Then there are those who say there are only ways to make a good thing worse.On New Year’s Day, Kris Mapes, who won a free trip to the Rose Bowl from a raffle at a sports bar in Columbus, Ohio, lauded the purity of this year’s contest while tailgating in the parking lot. With Ohio State playing Washington, the game featured the Big Ten champion versus the Pacific-12 champion — just like in the old days, when, for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947, that matchup was a given.“With the playoff, there’s always an argument,” Mapes said, referring to the gripes of some teams left out of the four-team College Football Playoff. “When you go Big Ten versus Pac-12 champs, there’s no argument. You’re the winner of the Rose Bowl.”It was the traditionalist’s response to a question increasingly being given the nontraditional answer. It’s also probably the only easy answer to a complex question.The most popular proposed reform to the playoff is to expand it further, making the bracket bigger at the expense of traditions like a classic Rose Bowl.The Rose Bowl is at the center of the playoff debate because of its importance to the Big Ten and the Pac-12, and because it is the oldest and most famous bowl game. That has historically made it the biggest stumbling block to altering the postseason: first with the creation of the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season; then, later, with the larger playoff that began with the 2014 season.“In order to make any type of agreement that led to the B.C.S., you had to have the Rose Bowl be a part of it,” said Roy F. Kramer, the former Southeastern Conference commissioner who helped start the B.C.S., from his home in Tennessee.Under the current playoff system, the Rose Bowl hosts a national semifinal game every three years, with teams selected by a committee with no regard for conference affiliation. In the other two years, like this one, the Rose Bowl matches a Big Ten team with a Pac-12 team, but it must release those conferences’ champions should they qualify for the playoff. Two years ago, for instance, the Pac-12 champion was placed in a semifinal, so the Rose Bowl featured the conference’s runner-up, Southern California.During halftime of Tuesday’s Rose Bowl game, Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott reiterated his support for the status quo, saying the playoff “works very well for us.”“Washington had 27,000 tickets to sell. They sold all of them,” Scott said. “They’d never come anywhere close at the Fiesta Bowl, which they were in last year, or the semifinal game two years ago. The fans don’t respond to the semifinal, to the Fiesta Bowl, the same way they do to the Rose Bowl.”Whether that is gospel or merely a negotiating position remains to be seen. The powers behind the Rose Bowl have bent before and may again.Scott Jenkins, chairman of the Rose Bowl Management Committee, wore a red blazer as he described the game’s appeal during the second quarter. “Especially if you’re back in the Midwest,” he said, “where it’s probably cold, maybe there’s snow on the ground — it’s New Year’s, you see on television the sun and the mountains and everybody smiling and happy, and bright colors on the field — real grass.”Jenkins pledged that the Rose Bowl would continue to insist on certain particulars, saying, “If you’re looking at red lines in the sand: Pasadena. Jan. 1. Two o’clock.”He could have pointed to this season’s television viewership, which was essentially identical to the national semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, according to ESPN.Yet with the power of college football settled firmly in the South, it is difficult to see an expanded playoff accommodating all of Jenkins’s demands, and nearly impossible to envision one that has room for a Rose Bowl that pits the Big Ten and Pac-12 champions against each other.The most commonly suggested eight-team system would replace conference championship games with the national quarterfinals, while giving automatic bids to major conference champions — making traditions like a “true” Rose Bowl exceedingly rare.To many casual fans, who tune into broadcasts of differently colored teams on similarly shaded fields that may as well be in Topeka or Tokyo, turning the Rose Bowl into just another playoff game — or into even more of what they might already consider an exhibition game — would not matter much. For them, expansion will simply more than double the number of playoff games.That makes expansion advocates on the inside of college football see dollar signs. It also raises the hopes of some unknown number of casual fans that their team can someday sneak into an eight-team tournament, generating unparalleled excitement and entertainment through December.But Kramer, who as much as any individual is responsible for the advent of a unified postseason, suggested caution.Expansion, he said, “would be a mistake.” For one, it would devalue the regular season, he argued.For another, it would threaten the importance of the bowls, which, however meaningless they may be in terms of championships, still hold value for participants and their fans.“I’ve been to a lot of bowl games,” Kramer said, “and I never saw a team that was disappointed by going to a bowl game.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David WaldsteinCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One of the most infamous dropped passes in football history clanged off Dallas Cowboys tight end Jackie Smith as he lay in the end zone during Super Bowl XIII.Poor Smith. Forty years ago, he had only his bare hands to try to pull in Roger Staubach’s low pass. Had he played in a more recent edition of the N.F.L. playoffs, he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky, silicone gloves that have transformed receivers’ mitts into virtual Spider-Man hands.The technological advances on the skin of those gloves have been so profound that they now enable receivers to snare passes their forebears never dreamed of catching, and in making the seemingly impossible possible, they may be changing the way football is played.The grippy polymer used on the new generation of gloves, said to be developed first by a Canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a Pakistan laboratory in 1999, is about 20 percent stickier than a human hand — according to a recent study by the M.I.T. Sports Lab performed at the request of The New York Times.The technology has made life easier for receivers at all levels, of course, and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip — pass catchers, but also quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends — not to make them part of his standard equipment. Even defenders have taken to wearing them.“The gloves definitely help with the one-handed catches,” said Rasul Douglas, a cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles who wears a Nike version. “You rarely see guys making one-handed catches without gloves on.”For those who have not played any football in the last 15 years, just touch a pair at a sporting goods store. It will be obvious why the gloves, now manufactured by several companies, are probably the most significant performance-related football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleat.“There’s no long-term statistical data that I’ve seen,” said Rich McKay, the chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the N.F.L.’s competition committee. “But they definitely make some difference, there’s no doubt about that.”When a catch is made, the naked eye often sees only hands grabbing a ball. But what is happening on the palms of a receiver’s gloves is far more complex: the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes — viscoelastic substances commonly known as silicone rubber. Silicone is used to make a wide range of products, including caulk, kitchen tools and Silly Putty. Receivers use it to make highlight-reel plays.According to Sanat Kumar, a professor of chemical engineering at Columbia University and a specialist in polymers, the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material acts as both a solid and a liquid.“It is macroscopically a solid,” Kumar explained of the silicone. “But at shorter, microscopic lengths, it is liquidlike.”That liquidlike property makes it sticky. Imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road. It skips right off. Now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey. The honey makes the grab. That is because the silicone surface of the gloves is, at the microscopic level, a viscous, honeylike liquid, and when a football comes in contact with it, the ball stalls in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid, like the honey. The ball must work to get through it.Anette Hosoi, a co-director of the M.I.T. Sports Lab and an associate dean of engineering at M.I.T., is an expert on the interface of soft materials. She and her students conducted experiments on a pair of blue Under Armour UA F6 gloves last week to quantify their tackiness, basically measuring the force required to pull a leather Wilson football over both the gloves and over a bare hand, in both dry and wet conditions.The experiments were led by Sarah Fay, an M.I.T. doctoral candidate, who determined the gloves had a coefficient of friction of 1.64 when dry, which is roughly 20 percent more grip force than that of a bare hand (1.37 CoF).(Fay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly, there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet hand.)Looking over a pair of Under Armour gloves in her office near the Charles River, Hosoi said the key to their performance was how soft and deformable the silicone is, meaning it covers and adheres to the tiniest variations on the surface of the ball, enabling it to almost melt into them.“Every time you get more deformable, you get a better adhesion,” Hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left hand.But as any coach or Eagles fan knows, adhesion alone does not guarantee catches. As Douglas, the Eagles cornerback, said before last week’s loss to the New Orleans Saints, “There’s people with gloves on who are still dropping passes every game.”The birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the University of Ottawa in 1995. A receiver named Jeff Beraznik, who would later found Cutters Sports Gloves, noticed a star player from rival Calgary, Donnavan Blair, fielding practice punts with one hand while wearing a pair of orange gloves.The next year, Beraznik called Calgary’s equipment manager and learned that Blair was wearing glass cutters’ gloves — rubbery mitts designed to protect workers and do-it-yourselfers from cuts from glass edges. Those gloves, he found, could be purchased at any hardware store.Beraznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly. They were not perfect, he said, but they were good enough, and once Beraznik’s teammates stopped making fun of him, they all wanted a pair of their own.“The whole team was, like, pass me a pair of those glass cutter gloves,” Beraznik said. Hence the name of his company, Cutters.Beraznik spent 18 months after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material, one that was stickier but also less bulky. He teamed with a safety glove company in Toronto called Midas, which sent him to a lab outside Karachi, Pakistan, to work with one of its chemists.With a football in hand, Beraznik made repeated trips to Karachi in the late 1990s, at times rolling up his sleeves to work on the formula — adding a little more of this and a little less of that. One day, he and one of the chemists arrived at the current formula, which was dubbed C-Tack.The modern glove, a huge improvement on the scuba diving gloves worn by N.F.L. receivers at the time, was born. Other manufacturers, including a company founded by Jim Sandusky (another Canadian football player), were working on similar products. Eventually Nike, Reebok, Under Armour and others produced their own.Even Lester Hayes, the former Oakland Raiders cornerback who was known for smearing his hands and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the 1970s, was impressed. After he came across a pair of Cutters, he sent a handwritten letter to Beraznik.“This is the greatest invention since stickem,” he wrote.That product, known by its brand name, Stickum, was outlawed by the N.F.L. in 1981 because of the utter mess it made — sticking not only to users, but also to opponents, referees and the balls themselves. The silicone gloves are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball. According to Rule 5, Section 4, Article 4, Item 8 of the N.F.L. rule book, “players may wear gloves with a tackified surface if such tacky substance does not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problems for players.”The most obvious result of the gloves can be seen in the startling one-handed catches that came into fashion after Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants made the most famous of all one-handed grabs against the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. Now almost everyone — in the N.F.L., college and even high school — has done it.In the Rose Bowl this month, Hunter Bryant, a sophomore tight end at the University of Washington, leapt for a high pass in the final two minutes of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand. By using only one hand, he was able to extend his reach and fend off his opponent.In a telephone interview, Bryant said that like most players today, he has worn silicone gloves since he played youth football. But once he saw Beckham’s gloved acrobatic snares on Sundays, he began practicing them.“Everyone practices them now,” he said. “I’ve gotten pretty good at it.”Hunter also noted that he feels he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hands, but he wears those sticky gloves anyway. He doesn’t want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day, wringing his bare hands the way Jackie Smith once did.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byletterA Johns Hopkins doctor says there is a need to develop treatments for survivors.To the Editor:Re “A Year Without Tom Brady” (Editorial Observer, Jan. 19):Alex Kingsbury makes the case that despite the scientific evidence supporting the link between repeated head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., and a decline in youth football participation, America’s sport shows no signs of slowing down. And yet the conversation continues to lack a real investment in treatment options for athletes living with the condition or who will go on to develop it.While efforts to improve diagnosis and prevent C.T.E. are critical, there is an even more urgent need to develop treatments for survivors to improve cognition, restore behavioral control, stabilize mood and reduce the impulsivity that can lead to acts of violence, rage, addictions and suicide.A better understanding of the molecular changes in the brain that result from repeated concussion will lead to innovative and effective treatments that will help rebuild lives, families and maybe even brains.It’s not enough to simply not tune in to the games; we must do more for the athletes and their families living with this insidious brain disorder.Daniel R.

"It is a joke for the federation to do such a thing, it's disgraceful on a football field."Vessicchio reiterated his criticism in a tweet after the match."I personally think that women refereeing in football is wrong for many reasons, so I confirm my thoughts," he said. However, he later apologised."I was wrong, I did something stupid," he said in an interview with CRC radio. "I expressed myself badly... the broadcast was live and I could not take back what I said."He said his criticism was aimed at the federation and the system. "I immediately noticed that I had said nonsense and will pay the consequences."There was no immediate comment from the broadcaster CanaleCinqueTv.Agropoli, who won 2-0, issued a "message of solidarity" for Moccia."The club firmly believes in the value of women, including those present in the world of football, be they assistant referees, coaches and players," said its president Domenico Cerruti on the club website.The incident happened on the same weekend that Juventus Women played at the club's Allianz Arena for the first time in front of a 39,000 crowd, by far the biggest attendance for a women's match in Italy. (Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Tariq PanjaOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches.Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions.“Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.”Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.)More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo.Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game.“For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.”Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.“We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.”Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation.Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.”Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.”In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict.“Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime.“It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”Advertisement
